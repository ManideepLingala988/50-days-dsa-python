Problem: K-th Symbol in Grammar (Recursion)

We start with a single '0' in the first row.
Each subsequent row is constructed from the previous row using the rules:
- Replace every 0 with 0 1
- Replace every 1 with 1 0

Given two integers n and k, return the k-th (1-indexed) symbol in the n-th row.

Example:
Input: n = 4, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
Row 1: 0
Row 2: 0 1
Row 3: 0 1 1 0
Row 4: 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
The 5th symbol in row 4 is '1'.
